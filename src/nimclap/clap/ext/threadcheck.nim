##  @page thread-check
##
##  CLAP defines two symbolic threads:
##
##  main-thread:
##     This is the thread in which most of the interaction between the plugin and host happens.
##     This will be the same OS thread throughout the lifetime of the plug-in.
##     On macOS and Windows, this must be the thread on which gui and timer events are received
##     (i.e., the main thread of the program).
##     It isn't a realtime thread, yet this thread needs to respond fast enough to user interaction,
##     so it is recommended to run long and expensive tasks such as preset indexing or asset loading
##     in dedicated background threads.
##
##  audio-thread:
##     This thread is used for realtime audio processing. Its execution should be as deterministic
##     as possible to meet the audio interface's deadline (can be <1ms). In other words, there is a
##     known set of operations that should be avoided: malloc() and free(), mutexes (spin mutexes
##     are worse), I/O, waiting, ...
##     The audio-thread is something symbolic, there isn't one OS thread that remains the
##     audio-thread for the plugin lifetime. As you may guess, the host is likely to have a
##     thread pool and the plugin.process() call may be scheduled on different OS threads over time.
##     The most important thing is that there can't be two audio-threads at the same time. All the
##     functions marked with [audio-thread] **ARE NOT CONCURRENT**. The host may mark any OS thread,
##     including the main-thread as the audio-thread, as long as it can guarantee that only one OS
##     thread is the audio-thread at a time. The audio-thread can be seen as a concurrency guard for
##     all functions marked with [audio-thread].
##  This interface is useful to do runtime checks and make
##  sure that the functions are called on the correct threads.
##  It is highly recommended that hosts implement this extension.
